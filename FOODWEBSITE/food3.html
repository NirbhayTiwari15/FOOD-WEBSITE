        <h3>About Food:</h3>
        <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried <br>bread (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked with a blend of aromatic spices, onions, tomatoes, and<br> ginger-garlic paste, creating a flavorful and hearty curry. The bhature are made from flour dough, fermented<br> with yogurt, rolled into discs, and deep-fried until golden and puffy. This indulgent dish is often served <br>with pickles or onions, adding a tangy contrast to the rich curry. Chole Bhature is a beloved street food <br>and a favorite in Punjabi cuisine, known for its bold flavors and satisfying texture.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the dried chickpeas in water overnight. Rinse and drain them before cooking. If using canned chickpeas, skip this step.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook the chickpeas with enough water and a little salt until they are soft and cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>    
            <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions are translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute and Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chickpeas and mix until they are well coated with the spice mixture. Add water if needed to adjust the consistency of the curry. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the bhature, combine the flour, yogurt, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Knead into a smooth dough, adding water as needed. Cover and let it rest for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small balls. Roll out each ball into a circle of about 6-7 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Fry the rolled out dough one at a time until they puff up and turn golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot chole with the bhature. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
