        <h3>About Food:</h3>
        <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish consisting of spaghetti noodles tossed in a <br>creamy sauce made with eggs, cheese (typically Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), pancetta or<br> guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. The sauce is created by mixing beaten eggs with the hot pasta, <br>which cooks the eggs slightly, creating a rich and velvety texture. The dish is typically garnished with <br>additional cheese and pepper. It is known for its simple yet indulgent flavors and is a popular comfort food worldwide.</p>
